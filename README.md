# CMOS-Capacitively-Coupled-Instrumentation-Amplifier-CCIA-Design

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a CMOS Capacitively-Coupled Instrumentation Amplifier (CCIA) intended for low-power, low-noise sensor readout applications. The CCIA architecture uses capacitor-based feedback to achieve high input impedance, accurate mid-band gain, and strong common-mode rejection, making it well-suited for fully integrated CMOS implementations. A custom single-ended high-swing telescopic cascode operational amplifier was designed at the transistor level to serve as the core gain stage, operating from a 1.8 V supply. The design process involved analytical hand calculations followed by extensive transistor-level simulations in Cadence Virtuoso to meet strict specifications on gain accuracy, bandwidth, noise, slew rate, output swing, and power consumption. Key performance metrics were verified through AC, transient, FFT, noise spectral density, and parametric analyses, with iterative optimization of device sizing and biasing circuits. The final design achieved a mid-band gain of approximately 100 V/V, a bandwidth from 8 Hz to 80 kHz, input-referred noise below 50 µV_RMS, and total power consumption under 100 µW, demonstrating the practical trade-offs between gain, noise, and power in analog integrated circuit design.
